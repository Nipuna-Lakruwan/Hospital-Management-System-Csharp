## 1. Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Windows application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations, including patient records, appointments, billing, and doctor management. The application aims to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the overall patient experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the HMS project, detailing each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure clarity and facilitate future development and maintenance.

### Scope
This documentation covers the requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the HMS application.

## 2. Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to log in to the system using their credentials.
- **Patient Management**: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and manage patient appointments.
- **Billing Management**: The system should handle billing processes, including generating invoices and tracking payments.
- **Doctor Management**: Users can manage doctor profiles, including their schedules and availability.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Security**: User data must be protected through encryption and secure authentication methods.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users and data without performance degradation.

## 3. Design

### Architectural Design
The HMS application follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (Windows Forms).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core functionality and business rules.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions using MySQL.

### User Interface Design
The application features a user-friendly interface with the following components:
- Login Page
- Dashboard for Admin and Doctors

- Appointment Scheduling Forms
- Billing Management Interface

### Database Design
The database schema includes tables for:
- Users
- Patients
- Appointments
- Billing Records
- Doctors

## 4. Implementation

### Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Microsoft Visual Studio

### Code Structure
The project is organized into several classes and user controls, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- `loginPage.cs`: Handles user authentication.
- `recsearch.cs`: Manages patient record searches.
- `RecDash.cs`: Displays the dashboard for doctors.
- `manageUsers.cs`: Manages user accounts.
- `generatebills.cs`: Handles billing processes.

### Key Classes and Methods
- **User Authentication**: `loginPage` class with methods for login validation.
- **Patient Management**: `recsearch` class with methods for searching and managing patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: `bookApp` class with methods for booking and managing appointments.

## 5. Testing

### Testing Strategy
The testing phase includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

### Test Cases
- **Login Functionality**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials and are denied access with invalid credentials.
- **Patient Management**: Test adding, updating, and deleting patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ensure appointments can be scheduled and viewed correctly.
- **Billing**: Validate that invoices are generated accurately.

### Testing Tools
- **Unit Testing Framework**: NUnit
- **Manual Testing**: Performed by QA team members.

## 6. Deployment

### Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed on hospital computers with the following steps:
1. Install the .NET framework if not already present.
2. Deploy the MySQL database and configure the connection strings.
3. Copy the application files to the target machines.
4. Create shortcuts for easy access to the application.

### User Training
Training sessions will be conducted for hospital staff to familiarize them with the application features and functionalities.

## 7. Maintenance

### Maintenance Plan
Post-deployment, the HMS will require regular maintenance, including:
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing any issues reported by users.
- **Updates**: Implementing new features based on user feedback.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly checking the applicationâ€™s performance and making necessary optimizations.

### Support
A support team will be available to assist users with any technical issues or questions.
