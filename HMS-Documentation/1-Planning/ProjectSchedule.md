## 1. Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Windows application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations, including patient records, appointments, billing, and user management. The application aims to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the overall patient experience.

### Objectives
- To provide a user-friendly interface for hospital staff.
- To maintain accurate patient records.
- To manage appointments effectively.
- To facilitate billing and payment processing.
- To ensure data security and privacy.

## 2. Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must log in to access the system.
- **Patient Management**: Ability to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and cancel appointments.
- **Billing Management**: Generate and manage bills for patients.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports for appointments, billing, and patient statistics.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle multiple users simultaneously without performance degradation.
- **Security**: User data must be encrypted, and access should be restricted based on user roles.
- **Usability**: The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

## 3. Design

### Architectural Design
The HMS follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (Forms, UserControls).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Handles business rules and data processing.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with the database (MySQL).

### User Interface Design
- **Login Page**: Allows users to authenticate.
- **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of hospital operations.
- **Patient Management**: Forms for adding and editing patient details.
- **Appointment Management**: Calendar view for scheduling appointments.
- **Billing**: Interface for generating and viewing bills.

### Database Design
- **Entities**: Patients, Appointments, Users, Bills.
- **Relationships**: 
  - One-to-Many between Patients and Appointments.
  - One-to-Many between Users and Appointments.

## 4. Implementation

### Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Visual Studio

### Code Structure
- **Main Entry Point**: `Program.cs`
- **User Controls**: Each functional area (e.g., `recsearch`, `DocApp`, `addNewRec`) is implemented as a UserControl.
- **Data Access**: MySQL commands are used to interact with the database.

### Key Classes and Methods
- **recsearch**: Handles patient search functionality.
- **DocApp**: Manages doctor-related appointments.
- **addNewRec**: Facilitates adding new patient records.

## 5. Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components are tested for functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different modules work together as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users validate the system against requirements.

### Test Cases
- **Login Functionality**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
- **Patient Record Management**: Test adding, updating, and deleting patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ensure appointments can be scheduled and viewed correctly.
- **Billing**: Validate that bills are generated accurately.
