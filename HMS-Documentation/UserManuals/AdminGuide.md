## 2. Requirements Analysis
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to log in to the system using a username and password.
- **Patient Management**: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and cancel appointments.
- **Billing Management**: The system should generate bills for patients based on services rendered.
- **Doctor Management**: Users can manage doctor profiles, including availability and specialties.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Security**: Sensitive data must be encrypted and access controlled.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Architectural Design
The HMS follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (Windows Forms).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core functionality and business rules.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions using MySQL.

### 3.2 User Interface Design
- **Login Page**: A form for user authentication.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub for navigating to different functionalities (patient management, appointment scheduling, etc.).
- **Forms**: Various forms for adding and editing records (e.g., patient details, appointment details).

### 3.3 Database Design
- **Entities**: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Bill.
- **Relationships**: 
  - A patient can have multiple appointments.
  - A doctor can have multiple appointments.

## 4. Implementation
### 4.1 Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Visual Studio

### 4.2 Code Structure
- **User Controls**: Each functionality is encapsulated in user controls (e.g., `recsearch`, `DocApp`, `addNewRec`).
- **Event Handling**: Events are used to handle user interactions (e.g., button clicks).

### 4.3 Key Classes and Methods
- **recsearch.cs**: Handles patient search functionality.
- **DocApp.cs**: Manages doctor-related operations.
