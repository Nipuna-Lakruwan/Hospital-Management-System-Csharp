## 2. Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to log in to the system using their credentials.
- **Patient Management**: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and manage appointments for patients.
- **Billing Management**: The system should handle billing processes, including generating invoices and tracking payments.
- **Doctor Management**: Users can manage doctor profiles, including their schedules and availability.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should handle multiple users simultaneously without significant delays.
- **Security**: User data must be protected through secure authentication and data encryption.
- **Usability**: The application should have an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate.

## 4. Implementation

### Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Microsoft Visual Studio

### Code Structure
The code is organized into several classes and user controls, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- `loginPage.cs`: Handles user authentication.
- `recsearch.cs`: Manages patient record searches.
- `DoctorDash.cs`: Provides the dashboard for doctors.
- `manageUsers.cs`: Manages user accounts and permissions.

## 5. Testing

### Testing Strategy
The testing phase includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

### Test Cases
- **Login Functionality**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials and are denied access with invalid credentials.
- **Patient Management**: Test adding, updating, and deleting patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ensure appointments can be scheduled and viewed correctly.
- **Billing Process**: Validate the generation of invoices and payment tracking.

### Tools Used
- NUnit for unit testing.
- MySQL Workbench for database testing.

## 6. Deployment

### Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed on hospital servers with the following steps:
1. Install the necessary .NET framework and MySQL server.
2. Deploy the application files to the server.
3. Configure the database connection strings.
4. Conduct a final round of testing in the production environment.

### User Training
Training sessions will be conducted for hospital staff to familiarize them with the application functionalities.
