## 1. Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Windows application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations, including patient records, appointments, billing, and user management. The application aims to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of healthcare services.

### Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the HMS project, detailing each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the methodologies employed.

### Scope
The HMS application will serve hospital staff, including doctors, administrative personnel, and support staff, allowing them to manage patient information, appointments, and billing processes effectively.

## 2. Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to log in to the system securely.
- **Patient Management**: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and manage patient appointments.
- **Billing Management**: The system should handle billing processes, including generating invoices and tracking payments.
- **Reporting**: Users should be able to generate reports on patient visits, billing, and appointments.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should handle multiple users simultaneously without significant delays.
- **Security**: Sensitive patient data must be protected through encryption and secure access controls.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all users.

## 3. Design
### Architectural Design
The HMS application follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (forms, buttons, labels).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Handles the core functionality of the application (data processing, business rules).
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions (CRUD operations).

### User Interface Design
The application features a user-friendly interface with the following components:
- Login Page
- Dashboard for Admin and Doctors
- Patient Management Module
- Appointment Scheduling Module
- Billing Module

### Database Design
The database schema includes tables for:
- Users
- Patients
- Appointments
- Billing Records

## 4. Implementation
### Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Microsoft Visual Studio

### Code Structure
The project is organized into several classes and user controls, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- `loginPage.cs`: Handles user authentication.
- `recsearch.cs`: Manages patient record searches.
- `DocApp.cs`: Manages doctor-related functionalities.
- `bookApp.cs`: Handles appointment booking.

### Key Classes and Methods
- **User Authentication**: `loginPage` class with methods for login validation.
- **Patient Management**: `recsearch` class with methods for searching and managing patient records.
- **Appointment Management**: `bookApp` class with methods for scheduling and managing appointments.

## 5. Testing
### Testing Strategy
The testing phase includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

### Test Cases
- **Login Functionality**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials and are denied access with invalid credentials.
- **Patient Record Management**: Test adding, updating, and deleting patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ensure that appointments can be scheduled and viewed correctly.

### Tools Used
- **Unit Testing Framework**: NUnit
- **Manual Testing**: Performed by QA team members.

## 7. Maintenance
### Maintenance Plan
Post-deployment, the HMS will undergo regular maintenance, including:
- Bug fixes
- Feature enhancements
- Performance monitoring

### Support
A support team will be available to assist users with any issues or questions regarding the application.
