## 1. Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Windows application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations, including patient records, appointments, billing, and user management. This documentation outlines the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) followed during the development of the HMS.

## 2. Requirements Analysis
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to log in to the system using their credentials.
- **Patient Management**: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and manage appointments.
- **Billing Management**: The system should facilitate billing processes, including generating bills and tracking payments.
- **User Management**: Admin users can manage other users, including adding new users and resetting passwords.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle multiple users simultaneously without significant delays.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Security**: Sensitive data must be protected through encryption and secure authentication methods.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Architectural Design
The HMS follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (Windows Forms).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Handles business rules and data processing.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions using MySQL.

### 3.2 User Interface Design
The application features a user-friendly interface with the following components:
- Login Page
- Dashboard for Admin and Users
- Patient Records Management
- Appointment Scheduling Interface
- Billing Management Interface

### 3.3 Database Design
The database schema includes tables for:
- Users
- Patients
- Appointments
- Billing Records

## 4. Implementation
### 4.1 Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Visual Studio

### 4.2 Code Structure
The project is organized into several classes and user controls, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- **User Control Classes**: `loginPage`, `recsearch`, `DocApp`, `addNewRec`, etc.
- **Data Access Classes**: Classes that handle database connections and queries.

### 4.3 Key Classes
- `loginPage`: Manages user authentication.
- `recsearch`: Handles patient record searches.
- `DocApp`: Manages doctor-related functionalities.
- `addNewRec`: Facilitates adding new patient records.

## 5. Testing
### 5.1 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each component was tested individually to ensure functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Components were tested together to verify interactions.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users tested the application to ensure it meets requirements.

### 5.2 Test Cases
- **Login Functionality**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
- **Patient Record Management**: Test adding, updating, and deleting patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ensure appointments can be scheduled and viewed correctly.
- **Billing Process**: Validate the generation of bills and payment tracking.

## 6. Deployment
### 6.1 Deployment Strategy
The application was deployed on hospital computers with the following steps:
1. Installation of the .NET framework and MySQL database.
2. Configuration of the database connection strings.
3. Deployment of the application executable.

### 6.2 User Training
Training sessions were conducted for hospital staff to familiarize them with the system's functionalities.

## 7. Maintenance
### 7.1 Maintenance Plan
- **Regular Updates**: The application will receive periodic updates to fix bugs and add features.
- **User Support**: A support team will be available to assist users with any issues.

### 7.2 Future Enhancements
- Integration with external health systems.
- Mobile application development for on-the-go access.

## 8. Conclusion
The Hospital Management System has been successfully developed and deployed, providing a comprehensive solution for managing hospital operations. The application meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined during the requirements analysis phase, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience for hospital staff.
