## 1. Introduction
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Windows application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations, including patient records, appointment scheduling, billing, and user management. The application aims to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of healthcare services.

### Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the HMS project, detailing each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the decisions made throughout the development process.

### Scope
The HMS application will serve hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel, allowing them to manage patient information, appointments, and billing processes effectively.

## 2. Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Users must log in to access the system.
- **Patient Management**: Ability to add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule, view, and cancel appointments.
- **Billing Management**: Generate and manage patient bills.
- **User Management**: Admins can manage user accounts and permissions.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should handle multiple users simultaneously without significant delays.
- **Security**: Sensitive patient data must be protected through encryption and secure access controls.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

## 3. Design
### Architectural Design
The HMS application follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components (Windows Forms).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Handles business rules and data processing.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations.

### User Interface Design
The application features a user-friendly interface with the following components:
- Login Page
- Dashboard for doctors and admin
- Patient records management
- Appointment scheduling interface
- Billing management section

### Database Design
The database schema includes tables for:
- Users
- Patients
- Appointments
- Billing records

## 4. Implementation
### Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Microsoft Visual Studio

### Code Structure
The code is organized into several classes and user controls, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- `loginPage.cs`: Handles user authentication.
- `recsearch.cs`: Manages patient record searches.
- `RecDash.cs`: Displays the dashboard for doctors.
- `manageUsers.cs`: Admin functionality for user management.
- `generatebills.cs`: Manages billing processes.

## 5. Testing
### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components were tested for functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensured that different modules work together as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conducted with hospital staff to validate the application meets their needs.

### Test Cases
- Verify user login functionality.
- Test patient record creation, updating, and deletion.
- Validate appointment scheduling and cancellation.
- Check billing generation and accuracy.

## 6. Deployment
### Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed on hospital computers with the necessary prerequisites installed (e.g., .NET Framework, MySQL).

### Installation Instructions
1. Install the .NET Framework if not already installed.
2. Set up the MySQL database and import the provided schema.
3. Deploy the application executable to the target machines.
